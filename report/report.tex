% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
This demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
for IEEE conference papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
IEEEtran.cls version 1.8a and later.
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
I wish you the best of success.

\section{Implementation of OLS}

\begin{eqnarray}
  Y = X \beta + \epsilon
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Closed Form}

With the traditional assumption of $X^T \epsilon = 0$
\cite{davidson2004econometrics}, i.e. that the error is 
uncorrelated with the matrix $X$, it is easy to solve for the weights, the
resulting equation is given by

\begin{eqnarray}
  Y &=& X \beta + \epsilon \\
  X^T Y &=& X^T X \beta + X^T \epsilon \\
  \hat{\beta} &=& (X^TX)^{-1}X^TY \\
\end{eqnarray}


\subsection{Gradient Descent}

It is computationally inefficient to invert large matrices such as the one
provided for this exercise. It is more efficient to minimize the sum of squares
$SSR(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n (Y-X \beta)^2$. We need to take the derivative to 

\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial SSR(\beta)}{\partial \beta} &=& -2 X^T (Y-X \beta)
\end{eqnarray}

\Else

        \State $i\gets i+k$
    \EndIf
\EndIf
\end{algorithmic}

\subsection{Lasso and Ridge Regularization}

To be able to generalize well to new data, we want to avoid over fitting. To do
so we will penalize extreme weights for our $\beta$

Talk about Occam's razor


\begin{algorithmic}
\If {$i\geq maxval$}
    \State $i\gets 0$
\Else
    \If {$i+k\leq maxval$}
        \State $i\gets i+k$
    \EndIf
\EndIf
